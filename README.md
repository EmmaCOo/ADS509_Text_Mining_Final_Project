# ADS509_Text_Mining_Final_Project


## Project's Goal

To classify the potential respective burger chain's customers for McDonalds, JackInTheBox, Sonic DriveIn, Wendy, and ShakeShack by using their tweets for each burger chain.

## Data Acquistion:

The datasets of customers' tweets for each burger chain and responses from the chain itself were obtained by Twitter API using Tweepy.

## Classification Models

Navies Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were trained as supervised classification models along Dummy classifier as Baseline model. Target classes were checked for class-imbalance. The accuracy of balanced and orignial datasets were compared to show the improvement of balancing the datasets.

## WordCloud

Wordclouds of customer's tweets and responses from the restaruants were displayed to see the most common words.

## Topic Modelings

Topic models with NMF, LSA, and LDA were performed to see the unique clsuters among five different burger chains.

## Results, Discussion, and Conclusion

The results were discussed at the end of each section.

## Discussion And Conclusion

The discussion and conclusion were discussed at the end of the notebook.
